Some performance benchmarks are given in this page.

= Introduction =

One major focus of rapidjson is runtime performance. The source code includes a simple performance test, which currently compared performance between rapidjson, [http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/ YAJL] and [http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/ JsonCPP].

=  Methodology =

The main test data is a 672KB synthetic UTF-8 JSON file, obtained from [http://code.google.com/p/json-test-suite/downloads/detail?name=sample.zip json-test-suite]. 

Testing platform:
  * Intel Core i7 CPU 920 2.67Ghz
  * Windows 7 64-bit
  * Visual Studio 2010 (VC)
  * Intel C++ Compiler 11.1 (ICC)
  * GCC 4.5.3 in Cygwin 1.7.9 (GCC)

= Results =

Following results are compiled from rapidjson/test/perftest.

All timing are in measured by running a test 1000 times. The results below is the average duration in microseconds.
